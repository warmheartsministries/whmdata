While these days we do not normally see demon-possessed people, the evil one is very much present and active, influencing us to turn away from God. May you protect me from their bad influence and continue to work in my heart so I will always cling to you. May you surround me with people who are right with you and grant me the grace to continue to minister to others for your glory."
