I cherish and I am grateful for the days that I get to spend with my spouse, my children, my family, and my friends, wishing for those happy moments to stretch forever. But more than these happy moments, we are made for your glory. The truth is, our days here on earth are numbered. Lord, for those whose hearts are made right with you through Jesus Christ, our life does not merely end on earth. I can look forward to celebrating life after death where everything is perfect and there is no more pain and sadness and fears. I pray for those whom I know and love, that they will also accept your gift of eternal life. In Christ's name. Amen."
