But Jesus wanted the woman to come forth to Him to give assurance that we can always come to His throne of grace with confidence. He wanted other people to see and hear what He was able to do. Now the woman and those who witnessed will be good testimonies of Jesus' power to heal."

You can even raise people from the dead. I trust that you will do what you think is the best for me and those around me, for your glory. May I calmly rest in your loving arms while I continue wait for your answers. May my lips give you the glory and utter praises to you for each healing and answered prayer that you give. At all times Lord, I am grateful, knowing that more than my physical needs, you have already given me my spiritual healing."
