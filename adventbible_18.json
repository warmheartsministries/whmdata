Water immersion is basically done when John baptized Jesus and those who repented of their sins and made a profession of their faith in God. Water cleanses, just as a believer in Christ was cleansed by His blood. Those who are in Christ are indwelt or filled by the Holy Spirit, they are no longer in bondage of their sins but through the Holy Spirit are capable of doing the good works which Christ set as an example."

May you give me the grace to see the light of Christ, repent and believe that Jesus alone can grant me eternal life."
